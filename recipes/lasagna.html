        <h2>STEPS TO PREPARE JELLOF RICE</h2>
        <un>
            <li>Blend your tomatoes, scotch bonnet and tatashe together. Chop your onions and keep 
            them aside.</li>

            <li>Put your rice into a bowl and soak with hot water. Allow this to soak
            for 10-15 minutes. Then, wash with warm water and keep aside, 
            or parboil your rice and wash. This is important as you will get 
          rid of excess starch in the rice.
         </li>

         <li>Put your oil in a pot and allow it to heat up.</li>

         <li>Add your chopped onions and allow to fry, but be sure not to 
             burn them.
        </li>

        <li>Add your blended ingredients and pur√©e and allow to fry, 
            just until you get rid of the sour taste (about 10-15 minutes).
        </li>

        <li>Add your maggi, garlic, ginger, curry, thyme and salt and mix together. 
            Be careful with your maggi as you do not want it too salty 
            (2 maggi cubes for a cup of rice). Add your stock or water, 
            and mix too. Taste to adjust to any seasoning.
        </li>

        <li>Pour your rice into the pot and mix together, 
            making sure it is covered in the tomato sauce.</li>

            <li>Cook on low medium heat. Check your rice after at least 10 minutes, 
                using a wooden spatula to dip into the rice. 
                This helps with getting the sauce to get the bottom of the pot, 
                so that it does not start burning when the rice is not cooked.
            </li>

            <li>Cook until soft. Do not overcook your rice or get your rice too soggy. 
                When rice is soft, lower the heat and allow to simmer so the water will get 
                completely dry.</li>

                <li>Rice is ready to serve. Serve with fried plantain and your choice of meat, 
                    if desired.</li>
