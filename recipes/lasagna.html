            tasty west African.
            one-pot Meal. It is a very versatile dish,
            and it is usually made from scratch using Rice,
            Tomatoes, Pimento peppers, Tomato paste, Scotch bonnet, Onions, Salt,
            and other spices.</p>

        <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
        <un>
            <li>rice</li>
            <li>Tomatoes</li>
            <li>peppers</li>
            <li>Onions</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Curry</li>
            <li>Maggi</li>
        </un>

        <h2>STEPS TO PREPARE JELLOF RICE</h2>
        <un>
            <li>Blend your tomatoes, scotch bonnet and tatashe together. Chop your onions and keep
                them aside.</li>

            <li>Put your rice into a bowl and soak with hot water. Allow this to soak
                for 10-15 minutes. Then, wash with warm water and keep aside,
                or parboil your rice and wash. This is important as you will get
                rid of excess starch in the rice.
            </li>

            <li>Put your oil in a pot and allow it to heat up.</li>

            <li>Add your chopped onions and allow to fry, but be sure not to
                burn them.
            </li>

            <li>Add your blended ingredients and purée and allow to fry,
                just until you get rid of the sour taste (about 10-15 minutes).
            </li>

            <li>Add your maggi, garlic, ginger, curry, thyme and salt and mix together.
                Be careful with your maggi as you do not want it too salty
                (2 maggi cubes for a cup of rice). Add your stock or water,
                and mix too. Taste to adjust to any seasoning.
            </li>

            <li>Pour your rice into the pot and mix together,
                making sure it is covered in the tomato sauce.</li>

            <li>Cook on low medium heat. Check your rice after at least 10 minutes,
                using a wooden spatula to dip into the rice.
                This helps with getting the sauce to get the bottom of the pot,
                so that it does not start burning when the rice is not cooked.
            </li>

            <li>Cook until soft. Do not overcook your rice or get your rice too soggy.
                When rice is soft, lower the heat and allow to simmer so the water will get
                completely dry.</li>

            <li>Rice is ready to serve. Serve with fried plantain and your choice of meat,
                if desired.</li>

                    you want them thinly sliced as you can see below.
                    What you find below is a bowl of fluted pumpkin leaves vegetables.
                    This is the equivalent of 12 cups. You should wash ugu
                     (fluted pumpkin) properly before slicing them.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        You can wash the water leaves after slicing them. 
                        Wash the leaves properly and transfer into a sieve to strain excess water.
                        You don’t want too much water in your vegetable soup.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Wash the roasted fish, remove center bone and break to 
                        smaller bits.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Season the goat meat with a teaspoon of salt, 
                        sliced onions and two seasoning cubes. 
                        Allow the meat to boil, add two cups of water and let the 
                        meat cook until it becomes tender and easy to chew.

                    <li>
                        To the boiling meat, add the washed, roasted fish.

                        Most people don’t like too much water in their vegetable soup, 
                        to achieve that, you have to use some tricks – 
                        like boiling the meat/fish till the water is almost dried.
                    </li>
